## What is Splunk?
Splunk is a business intelligence tool, a security incident and event management tool and much more.
Also <img width="615" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-11 at 3 23 04 PM" src="https://github.com/Surbhi-Kohli/Splunk/assets/32058209/158a9fdc-af99-4570-8c8a-f8cffc576976">

Hidden in your organization's data is a gold mine of useful, actionable knowledge. Data is generated by everything in the modern world.
**Humans** generate data by their actions, Web clicks, purchases, logins and everything else we do.
**Machines** generate data because they record literally everything they do and everything that happens to them.These are things like sys logs ,application logs and a lot of other metrics.
Splunk takes this data, any type of data, unstructured, structured,machine generated, human generated and allows you to create real value from that data in the form of rich reports, live dashboards and alerts triggered in a timely manner.

Consider a typical modern organization.It might have some assets in various cloud providers, perhaps Office 365 with Azure Active Directory and maybe a few other Azure services.It might have some big data solutions built out in Google Cloud Platform and some infrastructure and Amazon Web Services.
It likely also has some on premises assets in the data center like physical servers and physical storage.Each and every one of these objects, every single machine or virtual machine or object like a container,knows and logs, exactly what happens to it at any given moment.

For example, they log incoming requests, outgoing messages, users and other systems with which they interact, actions they take and much, much more.

Anyone who has sifted through a log file export knows what I'm talking about.But what generally happens to all of this data, it gets dumped into a veritable black hole.Nobody looks at it or cares about it until there's a problem.
Then IT pros are left with manually searching through tens of thousands of log entries trying to investigate the situation and figure out what exactly happened.

There's a better way with Splunk, we can set up a system to capture
this data, clean it, format it, transform it and make it sync.Splunk is great at reading and parsing machine data, in particular, it's a fully fledged business
intelligence tool, data analytics and science tool, security, incident management, management tool and much more.

But one of its primary superpowers is parsing machine data, typical data generated by machines and by machines, of course, I mean any systems or objects in the cloud as well generate data, specifically log data,that is cryptic(non human readable).It kind of looks like this blob of random characters.

We can train Splunk to look for certain patterns in the data and then label those patterns as fields.We can then take those fields and build intelligent systems that show us the data in an understandable way.
